    Whales are big and marshmallows are very small. </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/DUMB WHALE.png" id="allimages">   <h3 id="alltext"> For this question, let's pretend we're using a blue whale. The volume of an average blue whale depends on many factors but if we assumed that it was about 90 feet long and the maximum girth of 80 feet, we should get around 5,170,800 cubic centimeters.  


    For the marshmallow, we can pretend that it is a perfect cylinder with height 1 inch and diameter 1 inch to get (using pi * r^2 * height)  12.87 cubic centimeters. Now, with some simple division, we get around 401,771.5617715618 ≈ 401,712 marshmallows. Since there are about 4 grams of sugar per 7 grams of marshmallows, that is about 2,811,984 grams of sugar. Also, there are about 16 calories per 4 grams of sugar, there is 11,247,936 calories.  
                    
                                   
    Since humans need around 2,000 calories a day, you could have a 5,624 day meal. You just have to get an empty blue whale and a lot of marshmallows. </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/MARSHMALLOW WHALE.png" id="allimages">   <h3>

    Oceans? Oh no... Let's say all the people on Earth gets to the coasts and starts drinking the ocean. Oh no... 

 
    Some stuff: A person can drink about 200-300(I will use 250) milliliters per minute. The ocean on the other hand is a whopping 321 million cubic miles of water. We are not going to talk about how it is not good to drink ocean water. 

 
    1M: I know that this isn't even close to the amount but we should at least see what we are working against. 250 mL is about 0.000000000000059978 cubic miles and 1M people will only drink 0.000000059978 cubic miles of water. We're pretty far. 

    1T: 0.000000000000059978 x 1T is pretty big. That’s 125 times bigger than 2024's current world population. But is that enough?? 0.059978 isn't making the cut. 

    1 quintillion: That is like really big! 59978 is a real step up from 1T but still, not the 321 million we were looking for. 

    Answer?: After some quick calculation, the answer is 5,351,962,386,208,276,368,001! This number goes up to the sextillions!! So in conclusion, you need as much people as there are grains of sand in the world!! Good luck recruiting that much people... </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/GRAIN TEST.png" id="allimages">   <h3>

        This problem is relativity easy. We can find the volume of all the mountains in the world by assuming they are all around 2,000 feet tall and there are about 1,187,049 mountains, we get 11,147,350,724,800,000 cubic feet of mountains. For the sea, we get 320.3 million cubic miles. If we get the mountain volume to be cubic miles, we get 75.3108 cubic miles. It is clear to say that the ocean's enormous mass will easily handle the mountains mass. </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN.png" id="allimages">   <h3>

    We can say that the school has K-8th grade to make things interesting. Without any adult, it should be chaos.  

    It is early in the morning at 7:30 AM and let's pretend you are 6th grade. The teacher isn't there and we won't worry about the how they disappeared. You'll be chatting with your friends assuming that there was some traffic this morning. Finally, some snoopy kid would walk outside at around 7:40 to check out the other classrooms. They would be surprised to see that there is no adult in any other room. Rumors will spread like wildfire and next thing, there is a bunch of kids at the hallway. Some kids will start to worry about food. </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/FOOD FIGHT.png" id="allimages">   <h3 id="alltext">                
    Going off the narration, let's talk about food really quickly.  
                        
                         
                        
    If we pretend that there are around 600 kids in the building, we can get some rough calculation for how much food there are.  
                        
                         
                        
Main Courses: 
                        
    There should be around 130 pounds of meat or fish. 
                        
                         
                        
    Of course, there might be some vegan people so the school should save around 40 pounds of vegan food. 
                        
                         
                        
Vegetables: 
                        
    These are foods like beans, broccoli, carrots, etc. Also, salad would count for this. Maybe around 130 pounds.  
                        
                         
                        
Fruits: 
                        
    Apples, bananas, or more should be around 100 pounds as well. 
                        
                         
                        
Grains: 
                        
    Maybe around 300 pieces of bread or rolls. 
                        
                         
                        
    For rice and pasta, around 30 pounds. 
                        
                         
                        
Dairy: 
                        
    To keep things simple, let's say the school only serves milk. They would have enough milk cartoons for every one and maybe 100 more. Around 700 cartoons. 
                        
                         
                        
Final: 
                        
    After some quick research and some estimating, I got around 1,500,000 calories. Back to our story. 
                        
                         
                        
                         
                        
    Kids start to raid the cafeteria and they start to take all the food. The older kids start to bully the younger and it becomes a war zone. The young ones can't fend for themselves and they will die in around a week or 2. But that doesn't matter. If every kid had the required amount of food in the first day, there would be 420,000 calories in day 2. Only 210 kids will have a proper meal by day 2. Within day 15, all of the 600 kids except for the 210 will die. Some will make it to a month but then, there is another problem.  
                        
                         
                        
Water and electricity: 
                        
    Usually, schools pay for water and electricity every month, so after a month, the school would go dark and the water fountain or the sink wouldn’t run. Only the strong will make it to day 31 and nearly no one will make it to day 34. RIP students. </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/COFFEE ISSUE.png" id="allimages">   <h3>

    This would have to be one big arena. All the dinosaurs, caveman, Greeks, renaissance, and modern people will appear on the arena. For a split second, it is silent. Suddenly, there are roars, blasts, and shouting. 

    There could be millions of outcomes in which time period comes out first but I will tell you the most obvious ones. (PICTURE) 
                        
Nukes: 
                        
    All the 1900 – 2024 people will gather to form a big group. The 20st centaury was known for many inventions and war and the most famous one was the nuclear bomb. It was created by a group of scientists wanting to stop the German invasion. However, the nuke got a lot more upgrades and today, the tsar bomb is known for being the deadliest. So, we can plan where we throw them and win history's deadliest battle. 
                        
Betrayal: 
                        
    Maybe the thing with the nukes does happen and people start to rebel against each other. The 1900 – 2000 starts to attack people from 2000-2024. The 21st centaury is known for people getting too reliable to technology but they know a couple more tricks than the 20st centaury. Good job 21st centaury people. </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/NUKE RIDE.png" id="allimages">   <h3 id="alltext">                 
Dinosaurs:                    
    Maybe the dinosaurs were smarter than we thought and they came up with a plan to gobble us up. With history, there is no knowing certain things. </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/dino.png" id="allimages">   <h3>
