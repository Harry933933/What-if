For this question, I will use dimensions of an average house which are about 50 x 50 square feet, about 13 feet high, and about 0.3 feet thick. 
                                            
                                                    
 50 * 50 * 13 = 32,500 
                                                    
 The empty space inside of our house/cube is (50-0.3) (50-0.3) (13 – 0.3) = 31,370.143 
                                                
 32,500 – 31,370.143 = 1,129.857

<h3 id="alltext">About 60,000 termites can eat 5 grams of wood a day. Saying the termite type is the Eastern Subterranean termite, we can convert the 5 grams of wood to cubic feet which is about 0.0050853119864000210365(let's call this "Annoying Number or AN) cubic feet.  
                    
                     
                    
 1,129.857 / AN which is 222,180.468577  rounded. Multiplying that by our 60,000 termites give us 13,330,828,115 rounded. This gives us how much termites we need in a day. However, we need a second so we multiply that by how many seconds are in a day to get our answer, 1,151,783,549,136,000. 
This number gives us that if all the termites stand in a line, it will be 18,220,232,440 miles!!</h3> <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/TERMITE BURGERS.png" id="allimages"> <h3 id="alltext"> This is equivalent to going around Earth 731,707 times!!(Also the same as going to the Sun and to Pluto about 4.5 times.) </h3> <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/SPACE TRIP.png" id="alltext">  <h3>

    Let's say that Jason broke his teeth while eating an apple and decided to destroy it. Many things might come to his mind. Let's try them all.

 

Natural causes. If we bury the apple in soil, it will slowly decompose into healthy nutrition. Even though this is good for the Enviromint, it will take between 1 - 6 month. I don't think Jason could wait that long. Let's go faster. </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/UNDERGROUND APPLES.png" id="allimages">  <h3 id="alltext">
How about eating? I know that Jason will probley never eat another apple in his life, but what if we gave it to a professional? The fastest recorded apple eating was 38 seconds. That is incredibly fast but we can do better. (PICTURE) 

 

Break the apple with force! According to some research, about 60 pound of strength is needed to be putted on an apple. Lets try it. 

</h3> <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/APPLE MISTAKE.png" id="allimages"> <h3 id="alltext">
Pretty good. But we can do better. 

 

A knife is the perfect weapon(*cough*) to destroy this apple. With a reasonably sharp blade, we can maybe chop an apple from 1 – 3 seconds. </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/CHOP CHOP APPLES.png" id="allimages">  <h3 id="alltext"> This is a big step up from breaking your wrist trying to break an apple with force but we can go faster. 

 

If we get a long ranged musket to fire a bullet through an apple, it will take literal milliseconds to destroy it. This is so fast that you could miss it by blinking! 

 

Instead of doing any of these tricks, we can always just chuck the apple in the trash can and forget about it. </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/APPLE DUNK.png" id="allimages">   <h3>

    You want to go to the North Pole and lived in Houston Texas. Your mom called you crazy and she did not give you a ride. Let's pretend that there is a direct road from Texas to the North Pole. </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/LONG ROAD.png" id="allimages">   <h3 id="alltext"> First,  let's do some guessing. Maybe a human walks about 3 feet a second and there is about 500K feet to the North P0le. So that is about 166,666.666667 seconds. 
        
    That's about 46 hours. Not bad. But let's get more accurate. 


    A human walks 4.7 feet a second and if there is a road connecting Houston to the North Pole, it will be 21,991,040 feet long. That is 4678944.68085 seconds. This is about 1299.70685579 hours. So in conclusion, if you have about 54 - 55 days and can live without sleep and food for that much days, I say you can go meet Santa. </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/SANTA CONFUSION.png" id="allimages"> <h3>

                    <h1 id="SHADOW" style="font-size: 100px; color: rgb(41, 246, 177);">Biggest Shadow</h1>
                    <pre>
                    <h3 id="alltext"> <strong style="color: rgb(240, 240, 114);">What is the biggest shadow you can make from yourself? ~ Hyuby</strong>
    
    
    Two things: Time, and place. Let's start with something easy. The time. Obviously, at noon, you create the shortest shadow of yourself. This is mainly because the Sun is directly above you. So the more the Sun is leaning, the more longer and bigger of a shadow will appear which happens usually at sunrise, or sunset. So stand at a vast open field during sunset and you will create a long shadow. Shadows depend on the Sun ray to hit different angles. The question just asked for the biggest shadow and no specific place so how about we leave Earth? 

 
    Couple things to consider: The length of a shadow is calculated with the formula; x = h/tan(a). X is the shadow length, h is the height of the object, and a is the angle from the shadow to the Sun. After some more research, I found out that the "angle from the shadow to the Sun" is x = arctan(h/t) where h is the height of the object, x is the "angle from the shadow to the Sun", and t is the distance from the object to the Sun. 
                        
                                          
    Moon: Using the formula that was given to use (see 1.), we find that the shadow length is about 9.8669484658303137081 meters. I wrote "about" because since there are craters on the Moon, it can create bigger and/or smaller shadows. Also, the lack of an atmosphere creates disturbances on light movement. Either way, 9.8669484658303137081 meters is about the length of a U-Haul truck or a really tall guy(I will do this for all the planets...) </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/MOON JUMP.png" id="allimages">   <h3 id="alltext">
                        
    Mercury: Since Mercury is closer to the Sun, it will create a smaller shadow. Using the formula, the shadow length is 0.9166695079989725 meters. This is nearly a 10th of the shadow in the Moon!! (Also about a human arm span or a VERY short person(I told you so...)) 
                        
                                          
    Neptune: I am happy to say that this is nearly impossible. </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/SHADOW RACE.png" id="allimages">   <h3>

    Lets start easy. 1/2 is also the same as flicking a coin and guessing heads or tails.(I won't count the thing about coins being 51/49…) That was fairy easy.  

 

    Now how about 1/100? After some intense research,  having a twin is about 1/100. Also, winning a scholarship is about 1/100 because of the high competitivity for college. 
                    
                     
                    
    1/1K? Instead of making heads or tails once, you have to make it 10 times in a row to get about 1/1000. This is not TOO rare though... 
                    
                     
                    
    1/1M? That's a big step up from 1K. Getting struck by lightning is about 1 in half a million and winning the lottery is about 1 in 13 million. Also(I'm still surprised about this) getting attacked by a shark is 1 in 3M?! </h3>  <img src="IMAGES/WHAT IF DRAWINGS/OCEAN SHARK DIVE.png" id="allimages">   <h3 id="alltext">
